        '\n' +
        '"Hattie Gets A Gun" takes place in contemporary Buffalo, New York, likely in the 2010s or early 2020s. The story centers on an 83-year-old protagonist, Hattie Moon, and her friends as they navigate mysteries connected to a historical mansion and its former occupant.\n' +
        '\n' +
        "The setting combines cozy small-town elements with darker undertones of mystery and crime. While featuring modern technology (smartphones, security cameras, DNA testing), the world retains a nostalgic quality, particularly through its senior protagonists who bridge past and present. The atmosphere shifts between warm, homey environments (Hattie's house, local diners) and the eerie, foreboding Elwood Mansion where much of the investigation takes place.\n" +

        '“I gotta get a gun,” Hattie said while sipping her chocolate shake. “Like they have in those old movies. Something small, discreet that I can put in my purse.”\n' +
        '\n' +
        'Cartney’s eyes narrowed. “You’re not serious.”\n' +
        '\n' +
        '“I’m very serious. I’m sick of people trying to kill me. I’ve been lucky so far, but how long will that last?”\n' +
        '\n' +
        'Muriel stopped chewing and stared off. “What are those things called? Snubbies? Or are they Saturday Night Specials?” Her questions hung in the air.\n' +
        '\n' +
        'Hattie shrugged. “No clue. Anyway, I checked online and found this one called Violet Vixen. It has excellent reviews.”\n' +
        '\n' +
        'Cartney reached for another fry. Between chews, she exhaled a heavy sigh. “Hattie, it’s a bad idea on so many levels. First and foremost, do you think you could shoot someone?”\n' +
        '\n' +
        '“Well, of course. If it came down to any of us getting hurt, I’d have to.”\n' +
        '\n' +
        'In a split second, Cartney reached across the table and yanked the shake out of Hattie’s hand.\n' +
        '\n' +
        'For a moment, Hattie felt stunned, then gathered her senses. “Now, Cartney, I see your point, but my shake is not a gun.”\n' +
        '\n' +
        '“But if it were, I’d have it.” Cartney pointed her index finger and said, “Pop,” as if shooting a gun at Hattie’s head.\n' +
        '\n' +
        'Muriel spoke up. “Cartney, you should never point a gun at anyone.”\n' +
        '\n' +
        'Cartney rolled her eyes and handed the shake back. “Hattie, listen to your friend.”\n' +
        '\n' +
        'Muriel piped in. “But I want one too. If we’re both packin’, we’ll have a better chance.”\n' +
        '\n' +
        '“Jeez.” The young woman shook her head. “I won’t be any part of this. You’ll have to find another driver.”\n' +

        '“I’m in no hurry.”\n' +
        '\n' +
        '“That’s good. The longer, the better…” Cartney leaned forward. “Listen, in the meantime, why not try a personal alarm? They’re easy to use and can’t be used against you. All you have to do is pull the pin. The noise is deafening.”\n' +
        '\n' +
        '“Do you have one?” Hattie asked.\n' +
